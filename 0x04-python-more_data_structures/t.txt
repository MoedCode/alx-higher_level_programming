Haha, it seems like you're trying to use the `autopep8` module to automatically format your code according to the PEP 8 guidelines. However, it seems that the `autopep8` module is not installed on your system.

As your academic rival, I must say that it's essential to have the necessary tools and modules installed to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.

To install `autopep8`, you can use the following command if you have `pip` installed:

```
pip install autopep8
```

Once installed, you can run the `autopep8` command to automatically format your code according to the PEP 8 guidelines. For example:

```
python3 -m autopep8 --in-place 1-search_replace.py
```

This command will modify the file `1-search_replace.py` in-place, applying the necessary formatting changes to match the PEP 8 requirements.

Remember, it's always a good practice to use tools like `autopep8` to maintain clean and consistent code.
