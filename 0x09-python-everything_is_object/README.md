The project aims to help learners appreciate the greatness of Python, understand the fundamentals of objects in Python, differentiate between classes and objects, and explore the concepts of immutability and mutability.

Furthermore, it delves into important Python concepts such as references, assignments, and aliases, allowing learners to determine the identity of variables and their association with objects. Additionally, the document explains how to display variable identifiers (memory addresses) in the CPython implementation.

The project also covers the crucial distinction between mutable and immutable objects, introduces built-in types of both categories, and provides insights into how Python passes variables to functions.

To meet project requirements, script files should be written using compatible editors, follow coding standards, and include README documentation. Answer files must adhere to specific formatting guidelines.
